# Mentorship

Working with students is one of the best parts of my job! I am lucky to collaborate with PhD students, and occasionally with Master's students and undergraduate students.

# PhD

**Current PhD students**: 
- [Neel Gupta](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/phd/profile/ngupta1)
- [Imani Finkley](https://imanif.github.io/)

My group broadly works in the fields of digital humanities, cultural analytics, and critical data studies/critical AI, with a focus on contemporary books and publishing, public libraries, cultural heritage, and social media.

In 2025-2026, I am not currently planning to accept new PhD students as a solo advisor, though there may be co-advising opportunities. You can learn more about other faculty in the iSchool and apply to the PhD program here: [https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/phd/admissions](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/phd/admissions). 

# Other Mentorship 

**RAships**: Occasionally I have other paid research opportunities for students (both graduate and undergraduate). When I do, I circulate advertisements to relevant departments on campus, and I will also post them here.

**Independent Studies**: Periodically I also supervise independent studies. However, I will not be supervising independent studies in 2025-2026.

**Summer Program**: I have worked with students for the past three summers through the [Humanities Data Science Summer Institute](https://humanitiesdatalab.ds.lib.uw.edu/opportunities/) at the University of Washington (available only to UW students). Pending funding HDSSI will run again in summer 2026, with applications opening in late winter/early spring.
