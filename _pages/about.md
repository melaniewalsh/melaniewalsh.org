Hi, I'm Melanie Walsh. I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Information School at the University of Washington](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/melwalsh). Before UW, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/walsh), where I worked with [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/). I received my PhD in English Literature from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.wustl.edu/). 

My research interests include data science, digital humanities, cultural analytics, literature, and libraries---preferably all of the above combined. You can download my full <a href = "assets/pdf/Walsh-CV-2024-10-06.pdf">CV<i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf"></i></a> here.

I am currently at work on a book project, [*When Postwar American Fiction Went Viral: Protest, Profit, and Popular Readers in the 21st Century*](/book), which follows the social media afterlives of American authors. 

I also designed and released a free, open-source textbook, [*Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python*](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/features/welcome.html), which introduces the programming language Python to people interested in the humanities and social science.

With wonderful collaborators, I also lead several projects that I'm proud of:
- [Post45 Data Collective](https://data.post45.org/our-data/)
- [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/)
- [AI for Humanists](https://www.aiforhumanists.com/)

In my free time, I like to play basketball 🏀, hike ⛰️, and paddle board among seal friends 🦭 (like in Shilshole Bay pictured above!).

**I am recruiting one student to join my group in 2025-2026. For more info, see ["Mentorship"](/mentorship).**
