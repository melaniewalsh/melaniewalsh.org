----------

I made a little game inspired by the Wordle universe. It's called <a href="https://melaniewalsh.github.io/versedle/" target="_blank">Versedle</a> (pronounced Verse-a-dle). You guess who wrote famous lines of literature.

I hatched this idea a couple of years ago with [Anna Preus](https://english.washington.edu/people/anna-preus), who picked many of the poems and passages. There are some real gems in here!

We're open to adding other passages/authors and/or being sponsored by a major literary organization ðŸ˜… The [Humanities Data Lab](https://humanitiesdatalab.ds.lib.uw.edu/) would love some collabs.

I borrowed lots of the code from [Tradle](https://github.com/alexandersimoes/tradle), which borrowed from [Worldle](https://github.com/markgalassi/worldle), which of course borrowed from Wordle. 

Thank you to these lil games that help me momentarily stave off existential dread!
