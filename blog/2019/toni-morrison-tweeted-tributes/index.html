She was the first Black woman to win the Nobel Prize in literature and the author of eleven novels, dozens of essays, as well as literary criticism. When Morrison’s publisher announced the news of her death on Tuesday morning, thousands of people began mourning her incredible life on Twitter. Within a little over a day, more than 500,000 Twitter users in fact cited Toni Morrison specifically by first and last name in a million tweets and retweets.</p> <p>To preserve this powerful commemoration of a historic American author, I started collecting tweets that mentioned “Toni Morrison” with <a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">twarc</a>, a digital tool created by Ed Summers and <a href="https://www.docnow.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DocNow</a>.

This policy, <a href="https://www.docnow.io/catalog/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">as DocNow puts it</a>, “speaks to users rights as content creators, while also allowing researchers to share their data with others.” Accordingly, I have shared a <a href="https://archive.org/details/toni-morrison-tweets" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data set</a> of 1,170,032 unique identifiers for tweets that mentioned “Toni Morrison” with or without a space between August 6 and August 9, 2019 on the Internet Archive. It will also be available through <a href="https://www.docnow.io/catalog/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DocNow’s Tweet ID Catalogue</a>.</p> <p>If you want to access and analyze this data yourself, you can do so with <a href="https://github.com/DocNow/twarc" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">twarc</a> or the desktop application, <a href="https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hydrator</a> (and the “hydration” process is explained in greater detail in both places). If you choose to use this data, I highly recommend consulting <a href="https://www.docnow.io/docs/docnow-whitepaper-2018.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DocNow’s white paper</a> about archiving social media content, especially their concluding recommendations:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>Archivists should engage and work with the communities they wish to document.</li> <li>Documentation efforts must go beyond what can be collected without permission from the web and social media.</li> <li>Archivists should follow social media platforms’ terms of service where they are congruent with the values of the communities they are attempting to document.</li> <li>When possible, archivists should apply traditional archival practices such as appraisal, collection development, and donor relations to social media and web materials.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <h1 id="reconstituting-and-rereading-tonimorrison">Reconstituting and Rereading Toni Morrison</h1> <p>The loss of Toni Morrison is a profound one. Like so many others, I am drawn to Obama’s widely recirculated words to put this loss into perspective. It really does feel like a “gift” to have “breathe[d] the same air” as the great Toni Morrison, “if only for a while.” It’s hard to imagine that a more major literary figure will be alive again during my lifetime.</p> <p>But it is also profound to have witnessed so many people testifying to Morrison’s literary influence and legacy this week, to have seen such sincere interest in her life and work, and to have observed the author reconstituted by those mourning and celebrating her on Twitter. These Twitter users collectively grieved Morrison—the author of deep, <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/03/toni-morrison-difficulty-black-women.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">difficult</a>, and complex narratives—in the necessarily reductive form of 240-character tweets, photos, and video clips, and they often did so with creativity, beauty, and power.</p> <p>Many of these Twitter users also spoke about returning to Morrison’s difficult novels (or essays or literary criticism) or about wanting to dive into them for the first time. There have been many <a href="https://time.com/5645078/toni-morrison-books/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“essential” Toni Morrison reading lists</a> published in the last few days, but I wanted to conclude by offering a short round-up of further scholarly reading on Morrison to also direct people to the work of scholars who have been studying and attending to Toni Morrison’s life and literature for many years now.</p> <p>Barbara Hill Rigney, <a href="https://ohiostatepress.org/books/BookPages/RigneyVoices.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Voices of Toni Morrison</em></a> (1991).<br> Trudier Harris, <a href="http://utpress.org/title/fiction-and-folklore/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fiction and Folklore: The Novels of Toni Morrison</em></a> (1991).<br> David L.
