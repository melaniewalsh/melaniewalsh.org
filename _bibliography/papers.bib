 abstract={The growth of social reading platforms such as Goodreads and LibraryThing enables us to analyze reading activity at very large scale and in remarkable detail. But twenty-first century systems give us a perspective only on contemporary readers. Meanwhile, the digitization of the lending library records of Shakespeare and Company provides a window into the reading activity of an earlier, smaller community in interwar Paris. In this article, we explore the extent to which we can make comparisons between the Shakespeare and Company and Goodreads communities. By quantifying similarities and differences, we can identify patterns in how works have risen or fallen in popularity across these datasets. We can also measure differences in how works are received by measuring similarities and differences in co-reading patterns.

 abstractNote={Through a computational reading of the online book reviewing community LibraryThing, we examine the dynamics of a collaborative tagging system and learn how its users refine and redefine literary genres. LibraryThing tags are overlapping and multi-dimensional, created in a shared space by thousands of users, including readers, bookstore owners, and librarians. A common understanding of genre is that it relates to the content of books, but this resource allows us to view genre as an intersection of user communities and reader values and interests. We explore different methods of computational genre measurement within the open space of user-created tags. We measure overlap between books, tags, and users, and we also measure the homogeneity of communities associated with genre tags and correlate this homogeneity with reviewing behavior.Finally, by analyzing the text of reviews, we identify the thematic signatures of genres on LibraryThing, revealing similarities and differences between them. These measurements are intended to elucidate the genre conceptions of the users, not, as in prior work, to normalize the tags or enforce a hierarchy. We find that LibraryThing users make sense of genre through a variety of values and expectations, many of which fall outside common definitions and understandings of genre.},

We provide a working definition of humanities research, summarize some of its most salient theories and methods, and apply these theories and methods to the current landscape of AI. Drawing from foundational work in critical data studies, along with relevant humanities scholarship, we elaborate eight claims with broad applicability to current conversations about generative AI: 1) Models make words, but people make meaning; 2) Generative AI requires an expanded definition of culture; 3) Generative AI can never be representative; 4) Bigger models are not always better models; 5) Not all training data is equivalent; 6) Openness is not an easy fix; 7) Limited access to compute enables corporate capture; and 8) AI universalism creates narrow human subjects. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of resisting the extraction of humanities research by computer science and related fields.},

  abstract = {Expressive Networks convenes an urgent conversation on digital media and the social life of contemporary poetry. Tracing how poems circulate through online spaces and how capitalized platforms have come to pattern the reading and writing of poetry, contributors emphasize both the expressivist cast of digital literary culture and the deep-running ambivalence that characterizes aesthetic and critical responses to platformed cultural production. The volume features chapters on Pan- African spoken word programs, Singaporean Facebook groups, decolonial hemispheric networks, and Japanese media-critical poetries as well as platforms such as Twitter/X, Instagram, and Amazon. Though contributors write from a variety of methodological positions and address themselves to a range of archives, they share the primary conviction that the impact of Web 2.0 on literary practice is far-reaching, far from self-evident, and far more variegated and unpredictable than easy summations of social media's influence suggest. Expressive Networks asks after poetry's present and future by examining what poems themselves express about the social make-up of networked platforms. Edited by Matthew Kilbane with contributions from Cameron Awkward-Rich, Micah Bateman, Andrew Campana, Sumita Chakraborty, Scott Challener, C.R. Grimmer, Tess McNulty, Michael Nardone, Seth Perlow, Anna Preus, Susanna Sacks, Carly Schnitzler, Melanie Walsh, and Samuel Caleb Wee. "Online platforms matter. Poetics, poetry writing, poetry reception, poetry criticism, and all the activities that seem adjacent to those things can be shaped, remade, narrowed, or given other dimensions not just by the fact of the Internet (which is old news) or by digital composition (arguably also old news) but by the particular layered platforms on which and amid which they stand. It matters whether a poet publishes on Instagram or by hand-coding a site. It matters who pays for a spoken-word tour and who puts the tour online and how. It matters to poetic composition whether a Facebook group devoted to that composition is locked and private or open to the public. And these matters have a history: we can do literary history with them, as well as aesthetic appreciation and detraction, criticism about criticism, media-network studies, and Marxist or sorta-of-Marxist critique. All these modes of analysis turn up in Expressive Networks, and all are used well. This volume will be a big deal." ---\textbf{Stephanie Burt}, Harvard University  "This important volume offers literary criticism augmented for the age of networked platforms. From its plugged-in introduction to its well-tuned chapters, Expressive Networks offers a collection of timely readings of digital poetic objects." ---\textbf{Mark Marino}, University of Southern California \textbf{Matthew Kilbane} is is an assistant professor in the English Department at the University of Notre Dame.

  abstract= {Modernist poet T.S. Eliot concluded his 1925 poem "The Hollow Men" with the iconic lines: "This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper." When Eliot died in 1965, the New York Times claimed in his obituary that these lines were “probably the most quoted lines of any 20th-century poet writing in English.” They may be among the most memed lines, as well. Through a computational analysis of Twitter data, we have found that at least 350,000 tweets have referenced or remixed Eliot’s lines since the beginning of Twitter’s history in 2006. While references to the poem vary widely, we focus on two prominent political usages of the phrase — cases where Twitter users invoke it to warn about the state of modern democracy, often from the left side of the political spectrum, and cases where they use the phrase to critique political correctness and “cancel culture” or to mock people for non-normatized aspects of their identities, often from the right side of the political spectrum. Though some of the tweets cite Eliot directly, most do not, and in many cases the phrase almost seems to be moving from an authored quotation into a common idiom or turn-of-phrase. Linguistics experts increasingly refer to this kind of construction as a “snowclone” —a fixed phrasal template, often with a culturally salient source (e.g., a quotation from a book, TV show, or movie), that has “one or more variable slots” into which users insert various “lexical substitutions" (Hartmann and Ungerer). },

  abstract = {Algorithmic systems are increasingly being adopted by cultural heritage institutions like libraries. In this study, we investigate U.S. public libraries' adoption of one specific automated tool -- automated collection diversity audits -- which we see as an illuminating case study for broader trends. Typically developed and sold by commercial book distributors, automated diversity audits aim to evaluate how well library collections reflect demographic and thematic diversity. We investigate how these audits function, whether library workers find them useful, and what is at stake when sensitive, normative decisions about representation are outsourced to automated commercial systems. Our analysis draws on an anonymous survey of U.S. public librarians (n=99), interviews with 14 librarians, a sample of purchasing records, and vendor documentation. We find that many library workers view these tools as convenient, time-saving solutions for assessing and diversifying collections under real and increasing constraints. Yet at the same time, the audits often flatten complex identities into standardized categories, fail to reflect local community needs, and further entrench libraries' infrastructural dependence on vendors. We conclude with recommendations for improving collection diversity audits and reflect on the broader implications for public libraries operating at the intersection of AI adoption, escalating anti-DEI backlash, and politically motivated defunding.},

 abstract={Generating poetry has become a popular application of LLMs, perhaps especially of OpenAI’s widely-used chatbot ChatGPT. What kind of poet is ChatGPT? Does ChatGPT have its own poetic style? Can it successfully produce poems in different styles? To answer these questions, we prompt the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models to generate English-language poems in 24 different poetic forms and styles, about 40 different subjects, and in response to 3 different writing prompt templates. We then analyze the resulting 5.7k poems, comparing them to a sample of 3.7k poems from the Poetry Foundation and the Academy of American Poets. We find that the GPT models, especially GPT-4, can successfully produce poems in a range of both common and uncommon English-language forms in superficial yet noteworthy ways, such as by producing poems of appropriate lengths for sonnets (14 lines), villanelles (19 lines), and sestinas (39 lines). But the GPT models also exhibit their own distinct stylistic tendencies, both within and outside of these specific forms. Our results show that GPT poetry is much more constrained and uniform than human poetry, showing a strong penchant for rhyme, quatrains (4-line stanzas), iambic meter, first-person plural perspectives (we, us, our), and specific vocabulary like “heart,” “embrace,” “echo,” and “whisper.”}, note={arXiv:2410.15299}, number={arXiv:2410.15299}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Walsh, Melanie and Preus, Anna and Gronski, Elizabeth},
