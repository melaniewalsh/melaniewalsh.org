Hi, I'm Melanie Walsh. I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/melwalsh) and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the English Department at the University of Washington. Before UW, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/walsh), where I worked with [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/). I received my PhD in English Literature from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.wustl.edu/). 

My research interests include data science, digital humanities/cultural analytics, literature, libraries, and social media---preferably all of the above combined. I investigate how data and computational methods shape contemporary culture ‚Äî such as the publishing industry and public libraries ‚Äî and how they can be used to understand culture in turn. You can download my full <a href = "assets/pdf/Walsh-CV-Current.pdf">CV<i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf"></i></a> here.

I am currently at work on a book project, [*When Postwar American Fiction Went Viral: Protest, Profit, and Popular Readers in the 21st Century*](/book), which follows the social media afterlives of American authors. 

I also designed and released a free, open-source textbook, [*Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python*](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/features/welcome.html), which introduces the programming language Python to people interested in the humanities and social science.

With wonderful collaborators, I also lead several projects that I'm proud of:
- [Post45 Data Collective](https://data.post45.org/our-data/)
- [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/)
- [AI for Humanists](https://www.aiforhumanists.com/)

In my free time, I like to play basketball üèÄ, hike ‚õ∞Ô∏è, and paddle board among seal friends ü¶≠ (like in Shilshole Bay pictured above!).

**I am recruiting one student to join my group in 2025-2026. For more info, see ["Mentorship"](/mentorship).**
