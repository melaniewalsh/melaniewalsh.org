Hi, I'm Melanie Walsh. I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/melwalsh) and an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the English Department at the University of Washington. I'm also on the Executive Council for the new [Center for Advances in Libraries, Archives, and Museums](https://calma.ischool.uw.edu/) (CALMA).

Before UW, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/walsh), where I worked with [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/). I received my PhD in English Literature from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.wustl.edu/). 

My research interests include data science, digital humanities/cultural analytics, literature, libraries, and social media---preferably all of the above combined. I investigate how data and computational methods shape contemporary culture — such as social media, the publishing industry, and public libraries — and how they can be used to understand culture in turn. You can download my full <a href = "assets/pdf/Walsh-CV-Current.pdf">CV<i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf"></i></a> here.

I am currently at work on a book project, [***When Postwar American Fiction Went Viral: Protest, Profit, and Popular Readers in the 21st Century***](/book), which follows the social media afterlives of American authors. 

I also designed and released a free, open-source textbook, [***Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python***](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/features/welcome.html), which introduces the programming language Python to people interested in the humanities and social science.

With wonderful collaborators, I also lead several projects that I'm proud of:
- [Post45 Data Collective](https://data.post45.org/our-data/)
- [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/)
- [AI for Humanists](https://www.aiforhumanists.com/)

In my free time, I like to play basketball 🏀, hike ⛰️, and paddle board 🦭. I am not the children's book author [Melanie Walsh](https://www.melaniewalshbooks.com/), but our interests are converging.
