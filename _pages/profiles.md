# Mentorship

Working with students is one of the best parts of my job! I am lucky to collaborate with PhD students, and occasionally with Master's students and undergraduate students.

# PhD

**Current PhD students**: [Neel Gupta](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/phd/profile/ngupta1)

**Future PhD students**: I am recruiting one student to join our group in 2025-2026. 

We broadly work in the fields of digital humanities/cultural analytics and critical data studies/AI, usually with a specific focus on literature, libraries, cultural heritage, and social media.

I look for students who have strong programming and technical skills but also welcome students with little to no computational background. I value students with investment in the humanities, especially literature and libraries.

If you're interested in joining my group, you can send me a short email about your *specific* research interests at melwalsh@uw.edu. Sadly I won't be able to respond to most emails, but I will note your interest, which is helpful.

To apply to work with me, you can [apply to the PhD program](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/phd/admissions) in the UW Information School and list me as an advisor. 
- Starting October 21, you can get feedback on your application materials from current PhD students through [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnyhCbhlhmD3QkjA8o4om7yttD1AKD-1USXjUZ9hg-PhjGpA/closedform). The program seeks to prioritize those from historically underrepresented groups or who have faced barriers in higher ed, but anyone can receive feedback. 
- There are also PhD information sessions on [October 14](https://ischool.uw.edu/events/2024/10/phd-information-science-information-session-faculty-panel-breakout) and [October 21, 2024](https://ischool.uw.edu/events/2024/10/phd-information-science-information-session-student-panel). 

# Other Mentorship 

**RAships**: Occasionally I have other paid research opportunities for students (both graduate and undergraduate). When I do, I circulate advertisements to relevant departments on campus, and I will also post them here.

**Independent Studies**: Periodically I also supervise independent studies. However, I will not be supervising independent studies in 2024-2025.

**Summer Program**: I have worked with students for the past two summers through the [Humanities Data Science Summer Institute](https://humanitiesdatalab.ds.lib.uw.edu/opportunities/) at the University of Washington (available only to UW students). HDSSI will run again in summer 2025, and I will post more information about this opportunity in early 2025.
